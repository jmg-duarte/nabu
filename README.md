# Seshat

> Seshat, was the ancient Egyptian goddess of wisdom, knowledge, and writing.
> She was seen as a scribe and record keeper.

Seshat brings [Dura](https://github.com/tkellogg/dura) to the foreground;
the main use case for Seshat is to constantly keep your work committed, automatically.

It watches over your files and when it detects changes,
Seshat will stage and commit them to your repository.

## Usage

Watch over a directory:

```bash
$ seshat watch <directory>
```


<!-- ## Configuration precedence

- Command-line flags
- `./seshat.toml` - current directory
- `~/.config/seshat.toml` - global configuration file -->
