Nabu brings [Dura](https://github.com/tkellogg/dura) to the foreground;
the main use case for Nabu is to keep your work committed.

It watches over your files and when it detects changes,
Nabu will stage and commit them to your repository.

## Get started

Watch over a directory:

```bash
$ nabu watch <directory>
```
